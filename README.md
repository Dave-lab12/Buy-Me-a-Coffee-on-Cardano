# Buy Me a Coffee on Cardano

## Technical Overview

This project involves creating a decentralized application (dApp) on the Cardano blockchain that allows for microtransactions, recurring donations, and multi-currency support. The dApp leverages Cardano's smart contract technology, ensuring low transaction fees, robust security, and a scalable infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Microtransactions:** Enable small, "coffee-sized" donations to be efficiently processed.
- **Recurring Donations:** Utilize smart contracts for setting up and managing subscription-style donations.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Include an integrated exchange feature to accept various cryptocurrencies, converting them to ADA or the creatorâ€™s preferred currency in real-time.

### Security and Compliance

- Utilize Cardano's security features to ensure all transactions are secure.
- Additional security checks and balances will be integrated into the platform.
- Compliance tools will help creators with tax documentation and regional regulations adherence.

### Architecture

- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Plutus, the smart contract platform for Cardano, to handle the logic for microtransactions and recurring donations.
- **Frontend:** Developed using modern web technologies to provide an intuitive user interface.
- **Backend:** Manages application logic, integrates with Cardano nodes, and handles data persistence.

### Development Phases

1. **Requirements Gathering and Initial Design**
2. **Tech Stack Selection**
3. **Smart Contract Development and Testing**
4. **Frontend and Backend Integration**
5. **Security Auditing and Compliance Checks**
6. **Deployment to Cardano Mainnet**
7. **Post-Launch Monitoring and Iterative Improvement**

### Open Source

- The project will be fully open source under the MIT License, hosted publicly on GitHub.
